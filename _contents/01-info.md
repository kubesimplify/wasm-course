We have been very excited about the way [WebAssembly (Wasm)](https://webassembly.org/) has been progressing and especially interested in being able to unlock capabilties running Wasm outside the browser.

We, having worked quite a bit with with Wasm and Wasm in the cloud-native ecosystem, we thought it would be interesting to work on a "fundamentals" video that talk about how one could start using Wasm. We try to keep the videos pretty easy to understand even if one does not know too much about software systems. We try to keep the scope of the video such that it equips one with an understanding of how Wasm works under the hood, why do we need it, what kinds of systems should you use Wasm with, and most importantly build up a good understanding Wasm to explore more yourself and build with Wasm.

The videos are put together by:

Thanks to [Kunal Verma](https://twitter.com/kverma_) and [Saloni Narang](https://twitter.com/I_saloni92) for (Rishit: crazy cool level of) editing the videos.
